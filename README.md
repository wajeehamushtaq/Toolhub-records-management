# Toolhub Record Management System
Toolhub is a community catalog of tools used across many Wiki projects. Its usefulness as such is directly linked to the amount and quality of information it contains. Currently, many tools in Toolhub have missing or incomplete information. While editing this information directly through Toolhub is of course possible, a more streamlined and gamified way with a dedicated UI could make editing faster and more enjoyable.
